Great!
Here is **Filtering Data** explained in the same simple, clear style you wanted.

# 🟦 **Filtering Data**

---

## **1) WHERE**

**Meaning:**
“Pick only the rows that match this condition.”

**Explanation:**

* WHERE filters rows before they are shown or processed.
* Only rows that satisfy the condition will be returned.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 500;
```

This means:
➡️ Show only those orders where the amount is greater than 500.

---

## **2) AND / OR / NOT**

### **AND**

**Meaning:**
“Both conditions must be true.”

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20 AND city = 'Pune';
```

This means:
➡️ Pick users who are older than 20 **and** also from Pune.

---

### **OR**

**Meaning:**
“At least one condition should be true.”

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE city = 'Pune' OR city = 'Mumbai';
```

This means:
➡️ Pick users from Pune **or** from Mumbai (or both).

---

### **NOT**

**Meaning:**
“Exclude rows matching this condition.”

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE NOT category = 'Electronics';
```

This means:
➡️ Show all products except Electronics.

---

## **3) IN**

**Meaning:**
“Choose rows that match any value from a given list.”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT', 'Finance');
```

This means:
➡️ Pick employees whose department is HR, IT, or Finance.

---

## **4) BETWEEN**

**Meaning:**
“Pick rows within this range (inclusive).”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;
```

This means:
➡️ Show products priced from ₹500 to ₹1000, including both limits.

---

## **5) LIKE**

**Meaning:**
“Match text using patterns.”

Common patterns:

* `%` → any number of characters
* `_` → exactly one character

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'Sa%';
```

This means:
➡️ Show users whose name starts with “Sa” (e.g., Sahil, Sam, Sanjay).

---

## **6) IS NULL**

**Meaning:**
“Find rows where the value is empty (NULL).”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE delivered_date IS NULL;
```

This means:
➡️ Show orders that have not been delivered yet.

---

## **7) IS NOT NULL**

**Meaning:**
“Find rows where the value exists (not NULL).”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE delivered_date IS NOT NULL;
```

This means:
➡️ Show all orders that have a delivery date.

---

## **8) EXISTS**

**Meaning:**
“Return this row only if a related row exists in another table.”

**Explanation:**

* EXISTS checks if the subquery returns *at least one row*.
* If yes → TRUE
* If no → FALSE

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT name 
FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id
);
```

This means:
➡️ Show users only if they have at least one order.
