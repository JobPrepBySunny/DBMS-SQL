Here is the **Triggers** section — explained clearly and simply just like you want.

---

# 🟦 **Triggers**

A **Trigger** is an automatic action that runs **when something happens** on a table.

👉 Example events: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
👉 Database executes trigger **without you calling it**
👉 Used to maintain consistency, logs, history, or validation

Think of a trigger like:
**“Whenever this happens → automatically do that.”**

---

# 🔥 Types of Trigger Timing

* **BEFORE** → Run trigger *before* the action
* **AFTER** → Run trigger *after* the action

---

# 🔥 Types of Trigger Events

* INSERT → when a new row is added
* UPDATE → when a row is modified
* DELETE → when a row is removed

---

## **1) CREATE TRIGGER (BEFORE INSERT)**

**Meaning:**
“Before inserting a new row, perform this action.”

**Explanation:**

* Useful for setting default values
* Useful for validating data
* Runs **before** the row is inserted

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER set_created_at
BEFORE INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
```

This means:
➡️ Whenever a new user is inserted, automatically set `created_at` to the current timestamp.

---

## **2) CREATE TRIGGER (AFTER INSERT)**

**Meaning:**
“After inserting a row, perform an action.”

**Explanation:**

* Used for logs, audit tables, notifications
* Runs **after** the row is successfully added

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_new_user
AFTER INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO logs(message)
VALUES (CONCAT('New user added: ', NEW.name));
```

This means:
➡️ Whenever a new user is added, insert a log entry recording their name.

---

## **3) BEFORE UPDATE Trigger**

**Meaning:**
“Run some logic before a row is updated.”

**Explanation:**

* Can validate or modify values
* Can prevent wrong updates

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_modified_time
BEFORE UPDATE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.updated_at = NOW();
```

This means:
➡️ Before updating a product, update its `updated_at` timestamp.

---

## **4) AFTER UPDATE Trigger**

**Meaning:**
“Do something after a row is updated.”

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_price_change
AFTER UPDATE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO price_logs(product_id, old_price, new_price)
VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.price, NEW.price);
```

This means:
➡️ When a product price changes, save old & new price in a log.

---

## **5) BEFORE DELETE Trigger**

**Meaning:**
“Run logic before deleting a row.”

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER backup_before_delete
BEFORE DELETE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO deleted_users_backup
VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.name, OLD.email);
```

This means:
➡️ Before a user is deleted, save their data in a backup table.

---

## **6) AFTER DELETE Trigger**

**Meaning:**
“Do something after a row is deleted.”

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_delete
AFTER DELETE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO logs(message)
VALUES (CONCAT('User deleted: ', OLD.name));
```

This means:
➡️ After a user is deleted, add a log entry.

---

## **7) Trigger Keywords: OLD vs NEW**

| Keyword | Used In        | Meaning                 |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **NEW** | INSERT, UPDATE | The new row values      |
| **OLD** | UPDATE, DELETE | The previous row values |

Examples:

* `NEW.name` → value being inserted/updated
* `OLD.name` → value before update or before delete

---

## **8) DROP TRIGGER**

**Meaning:**
“Remove a trigger.”

**Example:**

```sql
DROP TRIGGER log_new_user;
```

This means:
➡️ Delete the trigger so it stops running automatically.
