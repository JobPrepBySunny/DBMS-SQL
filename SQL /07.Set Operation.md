Great!
Here is the **Set Operations** section explained in the same simple, beginner-friendly style.

---

# 🟦 **Set Operations**

Set operations combine the results of **two SELECT queries**.

Think of it like:
👉 “Take result A, take result B, and apply a rule to merge them.”

Both SELECT queries must have **same number of columns** and **same data types**.

---

## **1) UNION**

**Meaning:**
“Combine results from both queries and remove duplicates.”

**Explanation:**

* Works like a mathematical union.
* If both queries return the same row → it appears only once.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT city FROM users
UNION
SELECT city FROM vendors;
```

This means:
➡️ List all cities found in users or vendors, but show each city only once.

---

## **2) UNION ALL**

**Meaning:**
“Combine results from both queries and keep duplicates.”

**Explanation:**

* Faster than UNION (no duplicate checking).
* If a city appears 5 times, it will appear 5 times.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT city FROM users
UNION ALL
SELECT city FROM vendors;
```

This means:
➡️ List all city values from both tables, including repeated ones.

---

## **3) INTERSECT**

**Meaning:**
“Show only the rows that appear in both queries.”

**Explanation:**

* Returns the **common** records.
* Works in PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server (not MySQL).

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT city FROM users
INTERSECT
SELECT city FROM vendors;
```

This means:
➡️ Show only those cities that are present in **both** tables.

---

## **4) EXCEPT** (or **MINUS** in Oracle)

**Meaning:**
“Show rows from query A that do NOT appear in query B.”

**Example (PostgreSQL / SQL Server):**

```sql
SELECT city FROM users
EXCEPT
SELECT city FROM vendors;
```

This means:
➡️ Show cities that are only in users table and not in vendors.

**Equivalent in Oracle:**

```sql
SELECT city FROM users
MINUS
SELECT city FROM vendors;
```

# ✔️ Next Section?

I can continue with:

👉 **Data Modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE — already done? but with advanced cases)**
OR
👉 **Indexing**
OR
👉 **Transactions**
OR
👉 **Views**
OR
👉 **CTE**
OR
👉 **Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LEAD, etc.)**

Tell me which section to continue:

**Continue Indexing** / **Continue Transactions** / **Continue Views** / **Continue CTE** / **Continue Windows**
