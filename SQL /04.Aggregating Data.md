Great!
Here is the next section, written in the same clear, simple explanation style.

# 🟦 **Aggregating Data**

Aggregation means:
👉 “Combine multiple rows and calculate something from them (like sum, average, count).”

---

## **1) COUNT()**

**Meaning:**
“Count how many rows are there.”

**Explanation:**

* COUNT(*) counts all rows.
* COUNT(column) counts only non-NULL values of that column.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

This means:
➡️ Tell me the total number of users.

---

## **2) SUM()**

**Meaning:**
“Add all the values together.”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders;
```

This means:
➡️ Add up the amount of all orders and give me the total sales.

---

## **3) AVG()**

**Meaning:**
“Calculate the average value.”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;
```

This means:
➡️ Add all ages and divide by how many users exist.

---

## **4) MIN() and MAX()**

**Meaning:**
“Find the smallest or largest value.”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT MIN(price), MAX(price) FROM products;
```

This means:
➡️ Show me the cheapest product and the most expensive product.

---

## **5) GROUP BY**

**Meaning:**
“Group rows that have the same value, then apply aggregation.”

**Explanation:**

* GROUP BY is used with COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
* It collects rows with common values.
* Each group gives **one output row**.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city;
```

This means:
➡️ Group users city-wise and show how many users live in each city.

---

## **6) HAVING**

**Meaning:**
“Filter groups after grouping.”

**Explanation:**

* WHERE → filters rows **before** grouping
* HAVING → filters groups **after** grouping

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

This means:
➡️ Show only those cities where more than 5 users live.

# 🔥 Quick Difference: WHERE vs HAVING

| Clause | Filters         | Used With       |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| WHERE  | Before grouping | Individual rows |
| HAVING | After grouping  | Groups          |
