Here is the **Transactions** section — explained in the same simple, crystal-clear style.

# 🟦 **Transactions**

A **Transaction** is like a “safe box” of SQL operations.

👉 Either **all statements succeed** (COMMIT)
👉 Or **none of them happen** (ROLLBACK)

Used to maintain **data accuracy**.

Example use cases:

* Bank money transfer
* Order placement
* Updating multiple related tables

---

## **1) START TRANSACTION / BEGIN**

**Meaning:**
“Start a protected block of SQL statements.”

**Explanation:**

* Begins the transaction.
* After this, changes are **not permanent** until COMMIT.

**Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

This means:
➡️ Begin a transaction block. Any changes now are temporary.

---

## **2) COMMIT**

**Meaning:**
“Save all the changes permanently.”

**Explanation:**

* Once committed, changes cannot be undone.
* Every modification inside the transaction becomes permanent.

**Example:**

```sql
COMMIT;
```

This means:
➡️ Everything done in this transaction is now saved.

---

## **3) ROLLBACK**

**Meaning:**
“Undo all changes made in the transaction.”

**Explanation:**

* Used when something goes wrong.
* Cancels all operations since START TRANSACTION.

**Example:**

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

This means:
➡️ Undo everything done after the transaction started.

---

## **4) SAVEPOINT**

**Meaning:**
“Create a checkpoint inside a transaction.”

**Explanation:**

* SAVEPOINT allows partial rollback.
* You can return to that point instead of undoing everything.

**Example:**

```sql
SAVEPOINT sp1;
```

This means:
➡️ Create a checkpoint named `sp1` inside the transaction.

---

## **5) ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT**

**Meaning:**
“Undo changes only up to a specific savepoint.”

**Explanation:**

* Does not cancel the entire transaction.
* Only undoes changes after the savepoint.

**Example:**

```sql
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
```

This means:
➡️ Undo changes made after savepoint `sp1`, but keep earlier ones.

---

## **6) RELEASE SAVEPOINT**

**Meaning:**
“Delete a savepoint.”

**Example:**

```sql
RELEASE SAVEPOINT sp1;
```

This means:
➡️ Remove the savepoint from the transaction.

---

## **7) SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL**

**Meaning:**
“Control how visible uncommitted changes are to other transactions.”

**Isolation Levels:**

* **READ UNCOMMITTED** → Can see uncommitted changes (unsafe)
* **READ COMMITTED** → Can only see committed changes
* **REPEATABLE READ** → Same rows appear even if others modify
* **SERIALIZABLE** → Highest safety, slowest

**Example:**

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

This means:
➡️ Make this transaction fully isolated from others.

---

# 🔥 Real-Life Example of a Transaction

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

This means:
➡️ Transfer ₹500 from account 1 to account 2.
➡️ Apply both changes *only if both succeed*.
➡️ If anything fails, rollback will save you.
