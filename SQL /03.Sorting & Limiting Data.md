# 🟦 **Sorting & Limiting Data**

---

## **1) ORDER BY**

**Meaning:**
“Arrange the rows in ascending or descending order.”

**Explanation:**

* By default, ORDER BY sorts in **ASC (ascending)** order.
* You can use **DESC** for descending.
* You can order by one or multiple columns.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age DESC;
```

This means:
➡️ Show all users but list older users first.

---

## **2) LIMIT**

**Meaning:**
“Show only this many rows.”

**Explanation:**

* Useful when you want the top N records.
* Works in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
```

This means:
➡️ Show only the first 5 products.

---

### **LIMIT with ORDER BY**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 3;
```

This means:
➡️ Show the top 3 orders with the highest amount.

---

## **3) DISTINCT**

**Meaning:**
“Remove duplicate values.”

**Explanation:**

* DISTINCT returns unique rows.
* If you use DISTINCT on multiple columns, the entire combination must be unique.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM users;
```

This means:
➡️ Show each city only once, even if 100 users live there.
