Here is the **Views** section — explained in the same simple, beginner-friendly style.

# 🟦 **Views**

A **View** is like a *saved SQL query*.

👉 It behaves like a virtual table.
👉 You can SELECT from it like a table.
👉 But it does **not** store actual data (unless it's a materialized view).

Views are useful for:

* Hiding complex queries
* Simplifying repeated logic
* Securing sensitive columns
* Giving limited access to certain data

---

## **1) CREATE VIEW**

**Meaning:**
“Save this SELECT query as a virtual table.”

**Explanation:**

* Whatever the SELECT returns, the view shows.
* You can use the view just like a table in SELECT queries.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name, email 
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';
```

This means:
➡️ Create a virtual table named *active_users* which contains only users whose status is "active".

---

## **2) SELECT FROM VIEW**

**Meaning:**
“Use the view like a normal table.”

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM active_users;
```

This means:
➡️ Show all rows from the virtual table `active_users`.

---

## **3) ALTER VIEW**

**Meaning:**
“Change the query behind the view.”

**Explanation:**

* Updates the logic of the view.
* Structure changes but name remains same.

**Example:**

```sql
ALTER VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name, email, created_at
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';
```

This means:
➡️ Modify the view to also include the `created_at` column.

---

## **4) DROP VIEW**

**Meaning:**
“Delete the view.”

**Explanation:**

* Does not delete the underlying table.
* Only removes the virtual table.

**Example:**

```sql
DROP VIEW active_users;
```

This means:
➡️ Remove the saved virtual table named `active_users`.

---

## **5) UPDATABLE VIEWS**

Some views allow INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

**Conditions for updatable view:**

* Must be based on *one* table
* Cannot use GROUP BY, DISTINCT, UNION, or aggregate functions
* Must contain primary key of base table

**Example:**

```sql
UPDATE active_users
SET name = 'Sahil'
WHERE id = 1;
```

This means:
➡️ Change the name in the base `users` table through the view.

---

## **6) NON-UPDATABLE VIEWS**

A view becomes non-updatable if it includes:
❌ JOIN
❌ GROUP BY
❌ Aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc.)
❌ DISTINCT
❌ UNION

Example (non-updatable):

```sql
CREATE VIEW city_counts AS
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total_users
FROM users
GROUP BY city;
```

You cannot:

```sql
UPDATE city_counts ...
```

Because:
➡️ Every row is aggregated; it does not represent one actual row in the database.

---

## **7) Why Use Views?**

### ✔️ To simplify complex SQL

Instead of writing long joins every time, save them in a view.

### ✔️ To hide sensitive data

Show only limited columns through the view.

### ✔️ To maintain consistency

Everyone uses the same SELECT logic.

### ✔️ To avoid rewriting queries

Define once → use everywhere.
